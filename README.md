# :coffee: Guji Webshop 

:eyes: See the deployed version [here]()

## Description

During my full-stack development bootcamp, the Guji webshop concept was born when deciding on a portfolio project as the final product. As my friend is in the course of opening a coffee roastery in Amsterdam, for which he will require a full-functioning webshop, the idea was to use this project as practice.

I have enjoyed building the back- and front-end for this website, starting with deciding on the design, wireframes, user stories and features. This project progressed my existing skills and allowed me to apply new functionalities by reading documentations, articles and watching tutorials.
